# MangroveMarkets Status Report

## Current State

- **Deployment + CI/CD configured and working** (ready to build the app).
- **Repo status:** main repo is **private**. A separate **public-facing docs repo** will be created at finish (docs, user guide, MCP server info).

## Current Focus
- **Frontend UI/UX update** (static landing pass). PR: https://github.com/mangrove-one/MangroveMarkets/pull/1
- **App build plan** drafted: `plans/app-build-plan.md`.

## Blockers / Risks
- None recorded today.

## Next Decisions Needed
- Confirm the **frontend update scope** (keyframes/3D prototype vs. static hero + staged motion).
- Confirm **MVP feature set** to start implementation.
