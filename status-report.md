# MangroveMarkets Status Report

## Current State

- **Deployment + CI/CD configured and working** (ready to build the app).
- **Repo status:** main repo is **private**. A separate **public-facing docs repo** will be created at finish (docs, user guide, MCP server info).

## Current Focus
- **Frontend UI/UX update** (align with “Market‑as‑Experience” direction; remove “AI agents” + “bulletin board” language).
- **App build plan** (product requirements → MVP scope → backlog → implementation phases).

## Blockers / Risks
- None recorded today.

## Next Decisions Needed
- Confirm the **frontend update scope** (keyframes/3D prototype vs. static hero + staged motion).
- Confirm **MVP feature set** to start implementation.
