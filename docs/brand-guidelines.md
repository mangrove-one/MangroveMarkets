## Color Palette

The Mangrove brand palette is dark but includes bright accent colors. All four colors pair with black, and each goes well with black in tandem. Avoid pairing the accent colors with each other.

### Primary Colors

| Color | Hex | RGB | CMYK | Pantone | Usage |
|-------|-----|-----|------|---------|-------|
| **Rich Black** | `#000000` | 0, 0, 0 | 80C 60M 40Y 100K | — | Backgrounds, text |
| **Pantone 7702** | `#42A7C6` | 66, 167, 198 | 70C 18M 16Y 0K | Pantone 7702 | Accent blue (darker) |
| **Pantone 630** | `#74C3D5` | 116, 195, 213 | 52C 5M 14Y 0K | Pantone 630 | Accent blue (lighter) |
| **Pantone 172** | `#FF4713` | 255, 71, 19 | 0C 87M 100Y 0K | Pantone 172 | Accent red-orange |
| **Pantone 1375** | `#FF9E18` | 255, 158, 24 | 0C 45M 97Y 0K | Pantone 1375 | Accent orange |

### Color Pairing Rules

**✅ DO:**
- Color on black
- Black on color
- White type on dark backgrounds
- One-color logo on chaotic or overly colorful backgrounds

**❌ DON'T:**
- Color on color (never pair accent colors together)
- Single-color mark (always use at least two colors in the logo mark)

|----------|------|--------|-------|
| **Headings** | Halyard Display | Bold | Title Case |

| **Body Copy** | Acumin Variable Concept | Semi-condensed Light | Sentence case |

## Logo

### Logo Variants

1. **Primary Logo** (horizontal) — Default for all applications
   - Mark (left) + Logotype (right)
   - The baseline of the logotype aligns perfectly with the baseline of the mark
   - The top of the capital M aligns with the interior points of the "roots" of the mark

2. **Stacked Logo** — Use when canvas is taller than it is wide (e.g., sponsorship opportunities)
   - Mark (top) + Logotype (bottom, centered)

3. **Standalone Mark** — Use when the brand is established and space is limited
   - Three-arch symbol only, no text

### Logo Best Practices

**✅ DO:**
- Use white type on dark backgrounds
- Use one-color logo on chaotic or busy backgrounds
- Maintain proper spacing (use the capital M height as a buffer)
- Respect proportions and alignment

**❌ DON'T:**
- Pair accent colors together in the logo
- Create new logo lockups or variations
- Mess with scale or proportions
- Add unnecessary shadows or effects
- Use a single-color mark (always use multiple colors)
- Tinker with the colors of the mark

### Spacing

When paired with other logos, buffer the space of the capital M should be used. There is some leeway, though. The descender of the lowercase g can extend into the buffer, as well as the top and lower left of the mark.

## Brand Pattern

The logo can be repeated to create an attractive, flowing background pattern.

### Pattern Guidelines

- **On white backgrounds**: Use pattern at a value **no greater than 3% black**
- **On black backgrounds**: Use pattern at a value **no less than 96% black**
- **For added depth**: A subtle gradient pattern can be added to the logo pattern

---

## Design Examples

### Web & Mobile

- Logo appears in top navigation (primary horizontal logo)
- Use black backgrounds with accent colors for CTAs
- Typography hierarchy: Halyard Display Bold for page titles, Halyard Text Medium for section headers

### Merchandise & Collateral

- Standalone mark works well on apparel (polo shirts, hats)
- One-color treatments (black or single accent color) are acceptable for merchandise
- Avoid mixing accent colors in a single design
