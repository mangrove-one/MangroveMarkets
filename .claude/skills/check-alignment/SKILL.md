$ARGUMENTS

Review this proposal against:
1. `docs/vision.md` — does it align with the stated vision?
2. `AGENTS.md` — does it follow project conventions?
3. `.claude/rules/architecture.md` — does it respect the architecture?

For each, state whether the proposal aligns or conflicts. If it conflicts, explain specifically what principle or decision it violates and suggest how to adjust.
